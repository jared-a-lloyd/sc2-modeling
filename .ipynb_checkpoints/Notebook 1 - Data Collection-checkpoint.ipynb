    "# Predicting StarCraft II Win Probability - Notebook 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "StarCraft II is a Real-Time Strategy game (RTS) which has been a popular eSport since its release in 2010. The game has progressed through a number of iterations, the most recent being named \"Legacy of the Void\" (LOTV), which was released in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the game work?\n",
    "The game is played on a map by two players (more than two players are possible but the primary focus of the competitive amateur and professional scene is 1 vs 1 games). It is a largely successful game, with around 500,000 players per season at its peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Player Population per Season](img\\avg-player-population.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<b>Average Player Population per Season</b> (<i>Source: <a href=\"https://www.rankedftw.com/stats/population/1v1/#v=2&r=-2&sy=c&sx=a\">rankedftw.com</a></i>)\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is MMR?\n",
    "A player will queue up for a \"ladder game\" (a game against another human competitor), and match-making is performed using MMR (Matchmaking Rating) which is a measure of player skill, similar to ELO in chess. A win or loss in a ladder game is used to update the MMR of both players, with the adjustment being proportional to the initial difference in MMR between the two players (i.e. beating a player with much higher MMR will result in a high adjustment). The MMR range is between 0 and around 7,500. Although there is no technical upper limit for MMR, once a player reaches such high levels, the relative MMR gain per game becomes very small because the MMR difference between other players becomes so large. A player with an MMR around 7,500 will gain only 1 or 2 MMR for a win, but lose as much as 50 or more MMR for a loss, making it difficult to increase their MMR over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game setup\n",
    "Each player chooses one of three races: Protoss, Terran, or Zerg - allowing for a total of 6 possible match-ups. The game begins with a player having 12 worker units and a main base. The basic strategy for the game is outlined by:\n",
    "* Use workers to mine one of the two resources on the map: Mineral or vespene gas.\n",
    "* Use workers to construct buildings to create military units, research upgrades, collect more resources, and defend their base.\n",
    "* Expand bases to new locations on the map. There are typically 5 to 7 bases available for each player to expand to.\n",
    "* Use military units to attack enemy units, while maintaining economic balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Winning the game\n",
    "A game is won when a player has destroyed all enemy buildings. However, games typically end earlier than this as one player concedes when it becomes clear that they can no longer win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the project\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter Notebook series is to model the win-probability as the game progresses. This would have 3 major use-cases:\n",
    "* *Broadcasting*: Professional games are widely broadcast, with the 2019 WCS Global Finals having an average live viewership of 36,430, peak viewership of 80,030 and prize pool of $500,000 __[source](https://escharts.com/tournaments/sc2/wcs-global-finals-2019)__. An overlay which occasionally updates viewers with the probability of one player winning would be an interesting feature to add, highlighting \"big moments\" in the game where the win-probability swings from one players favor to the other.\n",
    "* *Player analysis*: It is common practice for players and professionals to re-watch their own games in order to understand how they performed, and what improvements could be made. This tool would allow for additional insights into which moments were most significant in affecting the outcome of the game, as well as helping players identify where they have conceded too early.\n",
    "* *AI training*: StarCraft II is already a popular field of study for AI, with Google's __[AlphaStar](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)__ having been trained to the point where it could even defeat professional players. Predicting the probability of victory for a given game state could provide an additional reward metric for training AIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, this methodology could also be applied to new games such as Age of Empires, or even popular turn-based strategy games such as Civilization VI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "Data are sourced from `SC2REPLAY` files which are autogenerated by the game client every time a game is played. StarCraft II is a fully deterministic game, meaning that the replay files simply contain a list of each and every action taken in the game, to find out what happens at any given moment in the game one has to simulate every action up until that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python package named __[sc2reader](https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader)__ is used to read the replay files, converting each replay into an object with attributes contain both metadata and game events. This package is used in a number of publically available replay analysis tools, as well as tools to analyze the actions most often taken by players in-game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A replay file contains data at a frame by frame level. Each frame represents 1/16th of an in-game second, and each in-game second is 1/1.4 of a real-time second (i.e. there are 22.4 frames per real-time second).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "Two datasets are collected:\n",
    "* __[Blizzard](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads)__: A collection of ~1.2 million replays which were are specifically provided by Blizzard (the game developers) for the purpose of training AI agents to play the game. These replay files are anonymized and contain only the actions taken by the players, and not the game state. In this study we use the Blizzard dataset to train a metadata model that attempts to predict the outcome of the game based only on the information available before the game starts. \n",
    "* __[SpawningTool](https://lotv.spawningtool.com/replays/)__: 48,479 replay files downloaded from a collection of user-uploaded replay files. These replay files are not anonymized and contain the game state at every moment in the game. In this study we use the SpawningTool dataset to train a neural network that predicts the probability of victory for a player as the game progresses. The dataset is also used as the test data for the Metadata Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "* **Notebook 1 (this notebook): Data Collection** - Process replay files to extract metadata and game events.\n",
    "    * Collect data from `SC2REPLAY` files:    \n",
    "        * *Metadata*: The information about the game, such as the map; player names, races, and MMR; and game outcome, length and region. Metadata for each dataset are stored in a single `csv` file per dataset. Data are collected using `sc2reader` using the `load_level=2` setting to increase speed of replay parsing (each load level increases the amount of detail extracted at the cost of additional processing time and memory).\n",
    "        * *Event data*: The actions taken by the players in the game, such as the units that were created, the actions taken by the players, their resource collection rates and spending, etc. Game events for each game are stored in a `pkl` file, named after the filehash of the original replay file. This allows easy referencing to a particular game events file from the metadata file.\n",
    "    * Clean Event Data\n",
    "        * Create a dataframe from each `pkl` file.\n",
    "        * Remove all irrelevant actions.\n",
    "        * Divide game events into actions taken by each player.\n",
    "        * Store a final dataframe that consists of a single row per frame of the game.\n",
    "* **Notebook 2: Metadata Analysis** \n",
    "    * Visually explore the metadata.\n",
    "    * Understand the split of player levels, races, regions, etc that are avaialable - particularly in the SpawningTool dataset that will be used to train the neural network.\n",
    "    * Model the outcome of the game based on metadata alone. Train the model using the Blizzard dataset and test it using the SpawningTool dataset.\n",
    "* **Notebook 3: Event data Analysis**\n",
    "    * Visually explore the event data\n",
    "    * Understand the types of actions that are taken, and create any new features that could be used to improve modeling.\n",
    "    * Construct and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the probability of victory for a player as the game progresses.\n",
    "    * Compare RNN to the Metadata Model to understand if the RNN is an improvement of game understanding.\n",
    "    * Conclusions and further work to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Notebook 1 an environment named `sc2` is created in Conda which contains the following required packages:\n",
