Initial modeling attempts will use the first 5 minutes of every game, later attempts will use the entirety of each game, but this will involve longer training times, both because there will be more data needed (we will likely need to re-aggregate the data to larger windows) and because we will need to train the model one game at a time, increasing the run time significantly.\n",

This will take the longest, but allows freedom for choosing how we set up the data (i.e. size of the train, validation and test sets; and how many minutes of data we use for each game). Once data are extracted we save them to `.npy` (numpy files) files for later use.\n",

    "#### 2.1.1 Extracting the data directly from the cleaned SpawningTool event data\n",
    "The code below can be uncommented to be extract data directly from the cleaned SpawningTool event data. The methodology is as follows:\n",
    "1. Read filehashes from SpawningTool Metadata.\n",
    "2. Remove the filehashes of games that we are not interested in based on `game_length` or any other criterion in the Metadata.\n",
    "3. Load dataframes of each games event data into a dictionary, indexed by the filehash.\n",
    "4. Split the keys up into train, validation and test sets. If required we can use stratify on any criteria in the Metadata to ensure that the train, validation and test sets are balanced.\n",
    "5. Create 3D tensors of the data:\n",
    "    * First make sure each dataframe contains the same columns (fill in missing columns with zeros) in the same order.\n",
    "    * Convert to 3D arrays of shape (Number of Games, Number of Events, Number of Features).\n",
    "    * Save to `.npy` files.\n",
    "6. Create 3D tensors of the target:\n",
    "    * 1 target for each game with a value of 1 if player 1 wins, and 0 if player 2 wins.\n",
    "    * Convert to 3D arrays of shape (Number of Games, 1, 1). The last two dimensions are 1 because there is only one target at one time for each game.\n",

    "Here we will train a simple RNN model with one layer of LSTM (long short term memory) cells. A default of 128 LSTM cells will be used, with BatchNormalization and Dropout layers added to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic explanation of the model architecture can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series) but a summary is included below:\n",
    "* **LSTM**: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is used to process time series and sequential data. It is different from a traditional neural network node in that it has feedback connections which allow it to learn patterns in the data. It was developed to be an improvement over traditional RNN, by dealing with the __[vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem)__. The __[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)__ contain a nice summary of the LSTM use-cases and __[this](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM)__ contains more information on setup and training. The most important options are:\n",
    "    * `kernel_regularizer`: Regularization to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "    * `return_sequences`: If True, returns the full sequence instead of only the last output. This setting allows multiple LSTM layers to be stacked. The final LSTM layer should have this set to False.\n",
    "    * `return_state`: If True, returns the last state in addition to the output. This is useful for passing the state to the next layer, and may be implemented in further modeling attempts because we are interested in predicting the state of the game.\n",
    "* **BatchNormalization**: `BatchNormalization` is a technique to reduce the effect of the vanishing gradient problem by normalizing the input and output of the network.\n",
    "* **Dropout**: `Dropout` is a technique to reduce overfitting by randomly dropping units from the network. Dropout of 0.2 means 20% of the units will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input shape of the model is (Number of Events, Number of Features) so that the model knows how to process the 3D tensor we are passing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final layer of the model will always be a `Dense` layer with a single node, and the activation function will be `sigmoid`. This is because we are trying to predict the probability of the game being won by player 1, and sigmoid is the function that returns this probability, similar to how Logistic Regression works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `binary_crossentropy` as the loss function as this is the standard loss function for binary classification problems. __(This post)[https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a]__ contains an interesting exploration of binary crossentropy, but to summarize: It is a loss function that penalizes wrong predictions more the higher their probability is. In other words, if the model has 55% probability for one prediction and 80% for another, but both are wrong, the 80% probability prediction would be penalized more.\n"

This would take a long time, and we would have to manually reset the hyperparameters each time.\n",

    "### 1.1 Extracting the event data\n",
    "Event data are stored in 3 pickle files, one each for the training, validation, and test sets. It should be noted that the these files contain all games from the SpawningTool set of length between 5 and 45 minutes. No other filters were applied before saving the data so as to allow for the full exploration of the data. Before modeling, the required filters will be applied to the hashlists to remove any games that do not meet the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will extract the training event data as this is the largest dataset. We do this by running a loop that extracts each of the pickle files and saves them to a list. Then we concatenate the entire list of dataframes to a single dataframe each for training, validation and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loop we also append three new columns:\n",
    "* `filehash`: The hash of the file that the event data was extracted from.\n",
    "* `winner`: 1 for Player 1, 0 for Player 2.\n",
    "* `frame`: The frame index of the dataframe is converted into a column. This is done to allow easy contenation without having to worry about the index being changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the loop, the file is written to file instead of being returned so as to prevent memory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select which replays go into which set we will use the scikit-learn `train_test_split` function. This will allow us to use stratified sampling to ensure that the data is balanced. A list of filehashes is created for each set, and then that filehash list can be passed to `create_combined_clean_df()` to create a dataframe of all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratification is performed by arbitrarily assigning a numerical value to each categorical variable. The array of filehashes is used as the X variable and the array of converted categorical variables is used as the y variable to allow for the specification of stratification.\n",

    "### Feature analysis\n",
    "We would like to have more insight into the features that are going to be modeled. However, with the large amount of feature columns that are available, it would be too time consuming and impractical to simply plot the distribution of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will analyze features based on the following criteria:\n",
    "* Most commonly present features - features which are present (i.e. non-zero) in the most games.\n",
    "* Least commonly present features - features which are present (i.e. non-zero) in the least games.\n",
    "* Features with the highest occurrence counts - features for which the sums of all values are highest.\n",
    "* Features with the highest variance from game to game - sum the features for each game and then calculate the variance of the sums.\n",
    "* Features which correlate most strongly to game outcome - using the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensuring all dataframes match\n",
    "First we need to make sure the columns of all dataframes match. To do this we will pass each dataframe through a function that compares the columns to the `master_columns_list`. The function is defined so that later it may be used in generating data for the model."
