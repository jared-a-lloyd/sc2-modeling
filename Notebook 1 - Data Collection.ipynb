    "# Predicting StarCraft II Win Probability - Notebook 1\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "StarCraft II is a Real-Time Strategy game (RTS) which has been a popular eSport since its release in 2010. The game has progressed through a number of iterations, the most recent being named \"Legacy of the Void\" (LOTV), which was released in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the game work?\n",
    "The game is played on a map by two players (more than two players are possible but the primary focus of the competitive amateur and professional scene is 1 vs 1 games). It is a largely successful game, with around 500,000 players per season at its peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/avg-player-population.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<b>Average Player Population per Season</b> (<i>Source: <a href=\"https://www.rankedftw.com/stats/population/1v1/#v=2&r=-2&sy=c&sx=a\">rankedftw.com</a></i>)\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is MMR?\n",
    "A player will queue up for a \"ladder game\" (a game against another human competitor), and match-making is performed using MMR (Matchmaking Rating) which is a measure of player skill, similar to ELO in chess. A win or loss in a ladder game is used to update the MMR of both players, with the adjustment being proportional to the initial difference in MMR between the two players (i.e. beating a player with much higher MMR will result in a high adjustment). \n",
    "\n",
    "The MMR range is between 0 and around 7,500. Although there is no technical upper limit for MMR, once a player reaches such high levels, the relative MMR gain per game becomes very small because the MMR difference between other players becomes so large. A player with an MMR around 7,500 will gain only 1 or 2 MMR for a win, but lose as much as 50 or more MMR for a loss, making it difficult to increase their MMR over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game setup\n",
    "Each player chooses one of three races: <font color='goldenrod'><b>Protoss</b></font>, <font color='firebrick'><b>Terran</b></font>, or <font color='darkviolet'><b>Zerg</b></font> - allowing for a total of 6 possible match-ups. The game begins with a player having 12 worker units and a main base. The basic strategy for the game is outlined by:\n",
    "* Use workers to mine one of the two resources on the map: Mineral or vespene gas.\n",
    "* Use workers to construct buildings to create military units, research upgrades, collect more resources, and defend their base.\n",
    "* Expand bases to new locations on the map. There are typically 5 to 7 bases available for each player to expand to.\n",
    "* Use military units to attack enemy units, while maintaining economic balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Winning the game\n",
    "A game is won when a player has destroyed all enemy buildings. However, games typically end earlier than this as one player concedes when it becomes clear that they can no longer win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter Notebook series is to model the win-probability as the game progresses. Previous work has been done on this topic __[\\[1\\]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1394/paper_3.pdf)[\\[2\\]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-machine-learning-approach-to-predict-the-winner-S%C3%A1nchez-Ruiz-Granados-Miranda/e8a52f985cfc6eee2b05fbd91c613397cc922b44)__, focusing on using primarily SVM (Support Vector Machine) to predict the winner of a game, based on the game's current state. These approaches were able to predict the winner of the game with an accuracy of 60% to 80% depending on how late into the game the winner was predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is attempting to use RNN, to impute the game state without requiring it to be explicitly calculated on some specific features (such as number of buildings, or composition of armies). RNN was chosen for the ability to remember game sequences of events, much like a human player would.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Broadcasting\n",
    "Professional games are widely broadcast, with the 2019 WCS Global Finals having an average live viewership of 36,430, peak viewership of 80,030 and prize pool of $500,000 (__[source](https://escharts.com/tournaments/sc2/wcs-global-finals-2019)__).\n",
    "\n",
    "An overlay which occasionally updates viewers with the probability of one player winning would be an interesting feature to add, highlighting \"big moments\" in the game where the win-probability swings from one players favor to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Player analysis\n",
    "It is common practice for players and professionals to re-watch their own games in order to understand how they performed, and what improvements could be made. Players even hire professional coaches to help them improve their skills for as much as __[US$85/hour](https://www.pigstarcraft.com/coaching/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool would allow for additional insights into which moments were most significant in affecting the outcome of the game, as well as helping players identify where they have conceded too early, perhaps saving them some of that coaching money.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) AI training\n",
    "StarCraft II is already a popular field of study for AI, with Google's __[AlphaStar](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)__ having been trained to the point where it could even defeat professional players. Predicting the probability of victory for a given game state could provide an additional reward metric for training AIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, this methodology could also be applied to new games such as Age of Empires, or even popular turn-based strategy games such as Civilization VI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "Data are sourced from `SC2REPLAY` files which are autogenerated by the game client every time a game is played. StarCraft II is a fully deterministic game, meaning that the replay files simply contain a list of each and every action taken in the game, to find out what happens at any given moment in the game one has to simulate every action up until that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python package named __[sc2reader](https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader)__ is used to read the replay files, converting each replay into an object with attributes contain both metadata and game events. This package is used in a number of publically available replay analysis tools, as well as tools to analyze the actions most often taken by players in-game. It is for this reason that the data extracted from replays is trusted as true and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A replay file contains data at a frame by frame level. Each frame represents 1/16th of an in-game second, and each in-game second is 1/1.4 of a real-time second (i.e. there are 22.4 frames per real-time second).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "Two datasets are collected:\n",
    "* __[Blizzard](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads)__: A collection of &pm;1.2 million replays which were are specifically provided by Blizzard (the game developers) for the purpose of training AI agents to play the game. These replay files are anonymized and contain only the actions taken by the players, and not the game state. In this study we use the Blizzard dataset to train a metadata model that attempts to predict the outcome of the game based only on the information available before the game starts. \n",
    "* __[SpawningTool](https://lotv.spawningtool.com/replays/)__: 48,479 replay files downloaded from a collection of user-uploaded replay files. These replay files are not anonymized and contain the game state at every moment in the game. In this study we use the SpawningTool dataset to train a neural network that predicts the probability of victory for a player as the game progresses. The dataset is also used as the test data for the Metadata Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "* **Notebook 1 (this notebook): Data Collection** - Process replay files to extract metadata and game events.\n",
    "    * Collect data from `SC2REPLAY` files:    \n",
    "        * *Metadata*: The information about the game, such as the map; player names, races, and MMR; and game outcome, length and region. Metadata for each dataset are stored in a single `csv` file per dataset. Data are collected using `sc2reader` using the `load_level=2` setting to increase speed of replay parsing (each load level increases the amount of detail extracted at the cost of additional processing time and memory).\n",
    "        * *Event data*: The actions taken by the players in the game, such as the units that were created, the actions taken by the players, their resource collection rates and spending, etc. Game events for each game are stored in a `zip` file, named after the filehash of the original replay file. This allows easy referencing to a particular game events file from the metadata file.\n",
    "    * Clean Event Data\n",
    "        * Create a dataframe from each `zip` file.\n",
    "        * Remove all irrelevant actions.\n",
    "        * Divide game events into actions taken by each player.\n",
    "        * Store a final dataframe that consists of a single row per frame of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook can be summarized as: *How can we extract meaningful data from a StarCraft 2 game replay file?*\n",
    "* **Notebook 2: Metadata Analysis and Modeling** \n",
    "    * Visually explore the metadata.\n",
    "    * Understand the split of player levels, races, regions, etc that are available - particularly in the SpawningTool dataset that will be used to train the neural network.\n",
    "    * Model the outcome of the game based on metadata alone. Train the model using the Blizzard dataset and test it using the SpawningTool dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook can be summarized as: *Are there inherent biases in the game which would lead to a certain player being expected to win (by choosing a certain race, map, etc)?*\n",
    "* **Notebook 3: Event Data Analysis and Modeling**\n",
    "    * Visually explore the event data\n",
    "    * Understand the types of actions that are taken, and create any new features that could be used to improve modeling.\n",
    "    * Construct and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the probability of victory for a player as the game progresses.\n",
    "    * Compare RNN to the Metadata Model to understand if the RNN is an improvement of game understanding.\n",
    "    * Conclusions and further work to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook can be summarized as: *How well can an independent observer predict the match outcome as the game progresses?*\n",
    "\n",
    "For Notebook 1 and 2 an environment named `sc2` is created in Conda which contains the following core packages:\n",
    "* `pandas`\n",

    "\n",
    "This process is broken down into two phases:\n",
    "1. **Metadata collection** - Extract the metadata from both SpawningTool and Blizzard datasets.\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning** - Explore the data to determine how much complete information is available. The data should be relatively clean, as duplicates are already removed during replay parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 - Processing replay files\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the metadata, the following steps will be followed:\n",
    "1. A python script `process_replays.py` is written using the IPython magic `%%writefile` to the scripts folder. The separate script enables the use of multiprocessing to greatly improve the speed of execution. (Note: `%autoreload` is used to make sure that if a script is run a second time after changing a `%%writefile` script, the script will be re-imported. Otherwise, the kernel requires a restart to reflect the changes.)\n",
    "2. A replay file is loaded using `load_replay` from the `s2reader` package. Load level 2 is selected as it contains the relevant player and metadata.\n",
    "3. The replay is parsed using the `ReplayInfo` class (found in scripts/classes/replay_info.py, and also written using `%%writefile`).\n",
    "4. The parsed replay is added to a list of replays which is then converted to a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "5. The dataframe is then written to a csv file. Separate csv files are created for SpawningTool and Blizzard replays in the data folder (`spawningtool_replays.csv` and `blizzard_replays.csv` respectively). \n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata collected are:\n",
    "* `Map hash` - this is used in preference to the map name, as different regions have different translations for the same map.\n",
    "* `Player races`\n",
    "* `Player MMR` (if available)\n",
    "* `Player highest league`\n",
    "* `Game length`\n",
    "* `Game outcome`\n",
    "* `Game type` (to ensure that the game is 1v1 instead of a 4 player game etc.)\n",
    "* `Game speed` (just as an additional check that the game format is correct)\n",
    "* `Game FPS` (just as an additional check that the game format is correct)\n",
    "* `Game timestamp`\n",
    "* `Region` of the game server that the replay was played on\n",
    "* `Filehash` - this is used to ensure that replays are not duplicated, and as an identifier for event data `pkl` files.\n",
    "* `Is_ladder` - If the game is a ladder game (again checking that the game format is correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Script to extract metadata from replay files\n",
    "A script is written to allow the use of multiprocessing to greatly improve the speed of execution. The settings in `replay_settings.json` allow the user to specify the number of cores that will be used during execution. Setting `n_jobs` to -1 will use all available cores minus one (to prevent locking up when all cores are occupied).\n",

    "The initial rules that will be used to filter the data are laid out below. The validity of the rules will be further explored in Notebook 2 during data exploration:\n",
    "* *The game should have a minimum length of 5 minutes* (300 real-time seconds) to be considered valid. This is because the first 5 minutes of the game is what will be used to train the initial neural network. Also, a game shorter than 5 minutes is likely to be what is called \"cheese\", i.e. a game where a player deliberately departs from the accepted opening moves in order to throw their opponent off balance.\n",
    "* *The game should have a maximum length of 45 minutes* (2,700 real-time seconds) to be considered valid. Games of 45 minutes are considered to be very long games, and are likely not to be representative of the game states that the neural network will be attempting to learn.\n",
    "* *Both players should have MMRs between 2,000 and 8,000* to be considered valid, as discussed above.\n",
    "* *Both players should have valid races* to be considered valid. If this is found to overly affect the number of replays available in Notebook 2, then possible imputation from event data will be considered.\n",
    "* *The game should be a 1v1 game* (2 players) to be considered valid. 1v1 games are the most common game format, and the exclusive format used in the professional circuit, games with more players are likely to confuse the neural network, without adding additional value.\n",
    "* *Region should be one of the following: \"eu\", \"us\", \"kr\", or \"cn\"* These are the primary server regions for StarCraft II (Europe, North America, Korea, and China respectively).\n",
    "* *fps should be 16* All replays appear to be played at 16 FPS, but this specification will be added to the model to allow for more flexibility in the future.\n",
    "* *is_ladder* Initially only True will be allowed, as ladder games are the official format for competitive games. However, because only &pm;10,000 of SpawningTool replays are ladder games, this may need to be reassessed if more data are required for neural network training.\n",
    "* *game_speed* This should be \"faster\" which is the default game speed for competitive games (i.e. 1.4 in-game seconds per real-time second).\n",
    "\n",
    "`%%writefile` will be used to write the filtering function to a file, which will be imported in Notebook 2. The script will be stored in the scrips folder."

    "There are 22 unique event names in the dataset. Below, we discuss the merits of each event and whether it should be included in the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Included events:**\n",
    "* `UnitBornEvent` - A unit is created. It may be beneficial to include this event, as certain units may impact the outcome of the game more than others (i.e. worker vs marine).\n",
    "* `UpgradeCompleteEvent` - An upgrade is completed. Upgrades are significantly impactful on the game, and so this will be included.\n",
    "* `PlayerStatsEvent` - This is expected to be the primary source of information for the model. Events of this type record the rate of mineral and vespene gas collection, as well as their currently supply and spending. This event will be included in the final dataset.\n",
    "* `UnitInitEvent` - Player begins construction of a unit or building. This would be useful for modeling as it would also indicate how often a unit is canceled (i.e. `UnitInitEvent` takes place with no `UnitDoneEvent`).\n",
    "* `UnitDiedEvent` - A unit dies. Certain units may be impactful on the outcome of the game (such as workers or a major fighting unit), and so this will be included.\n",
    "* `UnitDoneEvent` - A unit or building is finished being built. This information could be informative for the model, as knowing when a player finishes building a defensive structure or new unit is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Included as part of a planned new feature:**\n",
    "* `APM` - This is a new feature (Actions Per Minute). It is commonly believed in the StarCraft community that APM is a very important metric in determining the outcome of a game. To test this hypothesis, a new feature will be created which calculates the APM of each player based on the following events:\n",
    "    * `SelectionEvent` - A player selects a unit. It is unlikely that this event would be meaningful for the model, as selections could be implied through the unit actions that are subsequently recorded. \n",
    "    * `SetControlGroupEvent` - A player sets up a control group. Since we are already measuring how often the player uses control groups, it is not necessary to include this event too.\n",
    "    * `UpdateTargetPointCommandEvent` - From `sc2reader` documentation *\"when the user changes the point of a unit. Appears to happen when a unit is moving and it is given a new command. It's possible there are other instances of this occurring\"*. This event is not expected to be very meaningful in predicting the outcome of the game.\n",
    "    * `ControlGroupEvent` - Discussed above.\n",
    "    * `TargetUnitCommandEvent` - A player issues a command with a target. It could be hypothesized that this would be informative. But, like `UnitPositionsEvent`, it does not directly reflect the game state, and thus will be excluded.\n",
    "    * `BasicCommandEvent` - A player issues a basic command. This event could be interesting in predicting the outcome of the game, but it would be difficult to determine what the command would be. Thus it will be excluded.\n",
    "    * `AddToControlGroupEvent` - Similar to `SetControlGroupEvent`, but when a player adds a unit to an existing control group.\n",
    "    * `UnitInitEvent` - Discussed above.\n",
    "    * `TargetPointCommandEvent` - Similar to `TargetUnitCommandEvent` but when the target is a point on the map instead of a unit. Might be useful for future modeling, but for now this event is excluded.\n",
    "    * `UpdateTargetUnitCommandEvent` - An extension of `TargetUnitCommandEvent`. This event is not expected to be meaningful in predicting the outcome of the game.\n",
    "    * `UnitTypeChangeEvent` - A unit changes type. There are many units in the game that have different forms (i.e. vikings can be in flying mode or landed mode). This event refers to a player action, and so can be used to calculate APM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SPM` - Another metric that is often discussed in the community is Screens Per Minute. This measures how many new screens are observed per minute (i.e. how many completely new locations a player observes in a minute). SPM will not be directly calculated (that would involve checking the postion of each and every screen to see how many unique screens there are), but a version of this could be calculated by merely measuring the number of times a screen moves per minute:\n",
    "    * `CameraEvent` - A player moves the location they are observing. This could be informative in seeing how player movement affects perception of the game. It will be included for now, but would have to be converted into a feature such as \"number of camera movements per frame\" which would be more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excluded events:**\n",
    "* `UnitPositionsEvent` - From `sc2reader` documentation *\"Generated every 15 seconds. Marks the positions of the first 255 units that were damaged in the last interval. If more than 255 units were damaged, then the first 255 are reported and the remaining units are carried into the next interval.\"*. It is possible that this event could be interesting in future work, but it would need to be combined with other metrics such as the positions of the bases and the camera locations the players are currently observing, so it will be excluded from this analysis.\n",
    "* `ChatEvent` - A player sends a chat message. This event could be interesting for studying how often a losing player types \"gg\" at the end of a game (which is considered courteous) but would not be very meaningful in modeling the game. Thus we will remove this event.\n",
    "* `PlayerLeaveEvent` - Player leaves the game. This is the event that decides the outcome of the game, i.e. first player to leave the game loses, and so would not be helpful in predicting the outcome of the game in advance.\n",
    "* `GetControlGroupEvent` - From `sc2reader` documentation *\"Extends :class:`ControlGroupEvent` This event replaces the current selection with the contents of the control group. The mask data is used to limit that selection to units that are currently selectable\"*. This event is not expected to be meaningful in predicting the outcome of the game.\n",
    "* `UnitOwnerChangeEvent` - A unit changes ownership. There are very few units which would trigger this event (for example Neural Parasite by an Infestor temporarily transfers control of a unit to the Infestor's player). So these events will be excluded.\n"

    "* Created 36,812 cleaned event dataframes with data aggregated to 5 second intervals (112 frames). These are stored in pickle files with the `.zip` extension in `data/clean_events`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Notebook, Notebook 2, will investigate the Metadata:\n",
    "* Exploratory data analysis will be performed to understand the distribution of players and statistics in both datasets.\n",
    "* Modeling of the Metadata to attempt predicting the game outcome at the outset of the game will be attempted. Blizzard data will be used to train, validate and test the model. And SpawningTool data will be used as a supplementary test."
